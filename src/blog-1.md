### Union Types

A union type allows us to input different types of data. It can be one type or another. Its actually workes with value that can be multiple types depending on the input. It helps us to flexiable our code with safety.

### Intersection Types

An intersection type allows us to combine multiple types together. It ensure all type should be included. We can combine multiple interface or types using Intersection types. We can extend types from different sources and combine them usin intersection.

### Conclusion

Union allows us to choose from different types of data, while Intersection helps in combining various types of data to create a more complex structure. This is how they helps us to write more flexible code by maintaining safety.
